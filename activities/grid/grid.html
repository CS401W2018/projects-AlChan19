            <li><strong>What Should You Focus on During and After Class?</strong>
                <p>Your focus should be listening carefully to the teacher's explanation during class. Pay close attention to understanding the concepts while they are being taught. After class, spend time practicing what you learned. Since HTML and CSS are hands-on subjects, experimenting with your code is the best way to improve.</p>

            <li><strong>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</strong>
                <p>Both CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox are used to arrange elements on a webpage, but they work in different ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system. This means it can control both rows and columns at the same time. Use CSS Grid when you need a full-page layout with both rows and columns.</li>
                    <li>CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system. It works in either a row or a column but not both at the same time. It is useful for aligning elements inside a container, such as navigation menus, buttons, or sidebars. Use CSS Flexbox when you need to align elements in a single row or column.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
