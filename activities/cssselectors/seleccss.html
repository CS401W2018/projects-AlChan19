            <li id="firstpar"><strong>List out the different ways to select an item.</strong>
                <br>You can select an item by tag name which applies styles to all elements of that type. An ID selects one specific item while a class can be used for multiple items. You can also select by attribute, which targets elements with a specific attribute. Another method is grouping which allows you to style multiple elements at once.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="blue"><strong>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</strong>
                <br>An ID is used for only one unique item while a class can be used for many. IDs are best for specific elements, the classes help apply the same style to multiple items.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="red"><strong>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</strong> 
                <br>A span tag is used for small parts of text inside a line while a div tag is used for larger sections, grouping multiple elements together.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="green"><strong>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</strong>
                <br>A div tag is a general container with no special meaning, while header, main, and footer tags have specific roles. The header is for the top section, main holds the main content, and footer is for the bottom section.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="orange"><strong>What are the different ways to select a color?</strong>
                <br>You can select a color by name, such as red or blue. Another way is using RGB values or HEX codes.
