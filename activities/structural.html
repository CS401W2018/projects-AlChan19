        <p>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?: It is where you can click on links and be transported into a specific page when clicked. It is possible for the navigation to go in the header but it is not necessary to be in the header, it depends on where you want to put it and how you want to design your website.
