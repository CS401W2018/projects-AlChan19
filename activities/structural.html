        <p>What goes in the header?:</p>
        <p>&ndash; It is where you can see a company/site's logo.  It may also include a search bar to help users find specific content and a login area where users can sign in to their account. It is important because it helps people navigate the site easily and quickly. It is one of the first things users see when they arrive, making it an important part of the website's layout.</p>
        <p>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?:</p>
        <p>&ndash; It is where you can click on links and be transported into a specific page when clicked. It is possible for the navigation to go in the header but it is not necessary to be in the header, it depends on where you want to put it and how you want to design your website. The navigation must not contain links to another website, it must only contain links from the company/site's website.</p>
        <p>What goes in Main?:</p>
        <p>&ndash; It is the home page of the website. It is the main content which is unique to a page. It is where the most important or most visited content is usually found and it helps guide users to other parts of the website.</p>
        <p>What goes in the Footer?:</p>
        <p>&ndash; It usually has contact details, links to important pages like About Us, Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, social media icons, a copyright note and sometimes the address. This section gives visitors quick access to useful information and helps them connect with the site.</p>
