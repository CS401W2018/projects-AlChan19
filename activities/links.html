        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</li>
            <p>An absolute link is a full address that takes you to a specific website <strong>(e.g., https://example.com)</strong>. A relative link is a shorter address that works based on where your file is <strong>(e.g., sample.html)</strong>. You use relative links to keep things simple and to make your links work easily within the same site.</p>
            <li>List the 3 rules with relative links.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the file name if the linked file is in the same folder <strong>(e.g., page.html)</strong></li>
                    <li>Use <strong>../</strong> to move up one folder <strong>(e.g., ../page.html)</strong></li>
                    <li>Use the folder name starting from the root to link to a file in a different folder <strong>(e.g., folder/page.html)</strong></li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</em></li>
            <p>Links donâ€™t always need to be inside a nav tag. The nav tag is used for main navigation links, like menus. But you can put links anywhere on a page, like in a paragraph or a footer, if they are not part of the main navigation.</p>
