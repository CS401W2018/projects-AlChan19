            <p><strong>AGE: 4 Years Old</strong></p>
            <p><strong>BIRTHDATE: April 5, 2021</strong></p>
            <p><strong>PERSONALITY: Sei is pretty chill most of the time, but when he's hungry, he gets super loud! He’s also really territorial, which is why he’s the only outdoor cat. He loves fighting with other male cats (he thinks he's tough!). He's got a bit of a "do my own thing" attitude but makes sure his space is respected.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>STORY: I’ve always wanted a cat and then this crazy thing happened, a friend of my mom’s had some debt to settle and when she found out we were looking for a cat, she gave us in Sei. It felt like destiny bringing him into our lives.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>AGE: 3 Years Old</strong></p>
            <p><strong>BIRTHDATE: August 26, 2021</strong></p>
            <p><strong>PERSONALITY: Skye’s basically a drama queen. I like to tease her, which makes her absolutely hate me sometimes (oops). She’s a little bit high-maintenance, but when she’s not mad at me, she’s super sweet and just loves to curl up next to you. She likes human food a lot.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>STORY: Skye is the cat of my older sister. She has a sensitive side and sometimes suffers from hair loss when she’s stressed. So, we had her spayed to help keep her healthy and reduce the stress. Now she’s happier and a little less dramatic (well, sometimes!).</strong></p>

            <p><strong>BIRTHDATE: May 5, 2022</strong></p>
            <p><strong>PERSONALITY: Seika is the quirky one. She’s got these random bursts of energy, like, why does she have to run around at 2 AM? But she’s also the sweetest cat ever. Always there for cuddles and comfort, she knows when you’re feeling down and just curls up next to you.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>STORY: Seika is the daughter of Sei, hence her name. When I was going through a tough time, Seika was always there for me, just sitting beside me and making everything feel a bit better.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>STORY: Flakes might seem like the sweetest little angel, but she’s a total goofball. She gets into anything she can find and is always running around, causing chaos. But honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="discussion-title">Responsible Pet Ownership</h2>
    <p class="discussion-text">In my experience, responsible pet ownership is about understanding the commitment, providing proper care, and ensuring the well-being of your pet. This includes feeding them well, giving them exercise, and offering emotional and physical care to keep them healthy and happy.</p>
