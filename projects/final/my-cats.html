                <p><strong>Sei is usually pretty chill, but when he‚Äôs hungry, he gets loud! He‚Äôs super protective of his space, which is why he‚Äôs our only outdoor cat. He thinks he‚Äôs tough and always picks fights with other male cats. We actually got Sei in a funny way because my mom‚Äôs friend owed her a favor and ended up giving him to us. It felt like he was meant to be ours.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Skye is the drama queen of the house. I tease her sometimes (just for fun), so she ends up mad at me but when she‚Äôs in a good mood, she‚Äôs super cuddly and sweet. She also loves sneaking human food. She‚Äôs actually my older sister‚Äôs cat, and she used to lose fur from stress, so we had her spayed. It helped a lot and now she‚Äôs a little less dramatic (well, kind of).</strong></p>

        <h2 class="discussion-title">Responsible Pet Ownership</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">In my experience, responsible pet ownership is about understanding the commitment, providing proper care, and ensuring the well-being of your pet. This includes feeding them well, giving them exercise, and offering emotional and physical care to keep them healthy and happy.</p>
