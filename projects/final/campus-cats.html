            <p><strong>AGE: 4 Years Old</strong></p>
            <p><strong>BIRTHDATE: April 5, 2021</strong></p>
            <p><strong>PERSONALITY: Sei is pretty chill most of the time, but when he's hungry, he gets super loud! He’s also really territorial, which is why he’s the only outdoor cat. He loves fighting with other male cats (he thinks he's tough!). He's got a bit of a "do my own thing" attitude but makes sure his space is respected.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>STORY: I’ve always wanted a cat and then this crazy thing happened, a friend of my mom’s had some debt to settle and when she found out we were looking for a cat, she gave us in Sei. It felt like destiny bringing him into our lives.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>AGE: 3 Years Old</strong></p>
            <p><strong>BIRTHDATE: August 26, 2021</strong></p>
            <p><strong>PERSONALITY: Skye’s basically a drama queen. I like to tease her, which makes her absolutely hate me sometimes (oops). She’s a little bit high-maintenance, but when she’s not mad at me, she’s super sweet and just loves to curl up next to you. She likes human food a lot.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>STORY: Skye is the cat of my older sister. She has a sensitive side and sometimes suffers from hair loss when she’s stressed. So, we had her spayed to help keep her healthy and reduce the stress. Now she’s happier and a little less dramatic (well, sometimes!).</strong></p>

            <p><strong>PERSONALITY: Seika is the quirky one. She’s got these random bursts of energy, like, why does she have to run around at 2 AM? But she’s also the sweetest cat ever. Always there for cuddles and comfort, she knows when you’re feeling down and just curls up next to you.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>STORY: Seika is the daughter of Sei, hence her name. When I was going through a tough time, Seika was always there for me, just sitting beside me and making everything feel a bit better.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>STORY: Flakes might seem like the sweetest little angel, but she’s a total goofball. She gets into anything she can find and is always running around, causing chaos. But honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="discussion-title">Personal Observations of the Cats and Their Interactions with Students</h2>
    <p class="discussion-text">The cats on campus at BYU-Hawaii have become part of the campus culture. Students often spot them lounging under trees, casually walking between buildings, or relaxing near the outdoor seating areas. Many students stop to pet them, and it's clear that the cats enjoy the attention and company. Some cats are more social and seek out human interaction, while others are a bit more reserved. It’s always heartwarming to see how the cats bring smiles to students' faces, offering a little stress relief during busy school days.</p>
    
    <h2 class="discussion-title">Challenges Faced by Campus Cats and the Importance of Humane Treatment</h2>
    <p class="discussion-text">While the campus cats are well-loved, they face challenges that we should all be aware of. As free-roaming animals, they are at risk of getting injured, lost, or malnourished. Some students unintentionally harm them by offering them food that is harmful or by disturbing them when they need rest. It’s crucial to treat these cats with respect, ensuring that they are not subjected to neglect or dangerous behaviors.Humane treatment is essential, this includes feeding them only appropriate food and ensuring they are not handled too roughly.</p>
    
    <h2 class="discussion-title">Responsible Ways to Interact with Campus Cats</h2>
    <p class="discussion-text">When interacting with the campus cats, it's important to be gentle and respectful. Here are a few tips for responsible interaction:</p>
    <ul class="discussion-text">
        <li><strong>Do not feed them harmful foods: </strong>Avoid giving them human food, especially foods that are toxic to cats, like chocolate, onions, and garlic. Stick to cat-safe treats if you wish to offer them something special.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not disturb them when they are resting: </strong>Cats, like any other animal, need their personal space. If you see a cat relaxing, let it be. Don’t approach it if it's not showing interest in interacting.</li>
        <li><strong>Be mindful of their health: </strong>If you see a cat that looks unwell or is behaving strangely, it's important to report it so they can get the necessary help.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="discussion-title">How to Report Lost or Injured Cats on Campus</h2>
    <p class="discussion-text">If you encounter a lost or injured cat on campus, it’s crucial to take action. The best way to report a lost or injured cat is to:</p>
    <ul class="discussion-text">
        <li><strong>Contact campus security </strong>for immediate assistance, especially if the cat is in a dangerous or high-traffic area.</li>
        <li><strong>Post a notice on campus bulletin boards or student groups </strong>to help locate the cat's owner or get help from others on campus.</li>
        <li><strong>Reach out to the animal care resources </strong>for guidance on how to handle injured or sick cats.</li>
    </ul>
