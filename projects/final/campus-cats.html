        <h2 class="discussion-title">Personal Observations of the Cats and Their Interactions with Students</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">The cats on campus at BYU-Hawaii have become part of the campus culture. Students often spot them lounging under trees, casually walking between buildings, or relaxing near the outdoor seating areas. Many students stop to pet them (especially me!) and it's clear that the cats enjoy the attention and company. Some cats are more social and seek out human interaction, while others are a bit more reserved. It’s always heartwarming to see how the cats bring smiles to students' faces, offering a little stress relief during busy school days.</p>
        
        <h2 class="discussion-title">Challenges Faced by Campus Cats and the Importance of Humane Treatment</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">While campus cats are well-loved, they face challenges that we should all be aware of. As free-roaming animals, they are at risk of getting injured, lost, or malnourished. Some students unintentionally harm them by offering them food that is harmful or by disturbing them when they need rest. It’s crucial to treat these cats with respect, ensuring that they are not subjected to neglect or dangerous behaviors. Humane treatment is essential, this includes feeding them only appropriate food and ensuring they are not handled too roughly.</p>

        <h2 class="discussion-title">Responsible Ways to Interact with Campus Cats</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">When interacting with the campus cats, it's important to be gentle and respectful. Here are a few tips for responsible interaction:</p>
        <ul class="discussion-text">
            <li><strong>Do not feed them harmful foods: </strong>Avoid giving them human food, especially foods that are toxic to cats, like chocolate, onions, and garlic. Stick to cat-safe treats if you wish to offer them something special.</li>
            <li><strong>Be mindful of their health: </strong>If you see a cat that looks unwell or is behaving strangely, it's important to report it so they can get the necessary help.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not disturb them when they are resting: </strong>Cats, like any other animal, need their personal space. If you see a cat relaxing, let it be. Don’t approach it if it's not showing interest in interacting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="discussion-title">How to Report Lost or Injured Cats on Campus</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">If you encounter a lost or injured cat on campus, it’s crucial to take action. The best way to report a lost or injured cat is to:</p>
        <ul class="discussion-text">
            <li><strong>Contact campus security </strong>for immediate assistance, especially if the cat is in a dangerous or high-traffic area.</li>
            <li><strong>Post a notice on campus bulletin boards or student groups </strong>to help locate the cat's owner or get help from others on campus.</li>
            <li><strong>Reach out to the animal care resources </strong>for guidance on how to handle injured or sick cats.</li>
        </ul>
