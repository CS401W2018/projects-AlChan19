        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is <strong>Alphea Eliza Podador</strong>, and I’m from <strong>General Santos City, Philippines</strong>. I’m currently majoring in <strong>Computer Science in Brigham Young University &ndash; Hawaii</strong>, and alongside my studies, I’ve always had a deep love for cats. In fact, my family and I have four cats at home, and they’ve brought so much joy and comfort into our lives. This love for cats has inspired me to become an advocate for their well-being, especially for those without homes. Through this site, I hope to combine my skills in technology with my passion for making a difference in the lives of cats.</p>
        <p>This site reflects my eagerness on helping cats and my goal to create a more compassionate environment for them. I believe that every cat deserves care, love, and a safe space to live. That’s why I started this platform, to raise awareness, share resources, and encourage others to take small steps in supporting stray and abandoned cats.</p>
        <p>Here, you’ll find stories and pictures of my own cats, information about the BYU–Hawaii campus cats, and educational content on community cats, spaying & neutering, fostering, adoption and buying pets. I also share helpful resources and ways you can get involved, whether you're nearby or supporting from afar.</p>
        <p>One of my personal goals is to feed stray cats regularly and inspire others to do the same. If you care about cats like I do, I invite you to join me in this mission by donating, spreading awareness, or simply showing kindness to the cats in your own community.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the rest of the site by visiting the pages on my cats, campus cats, be informed, be involved, and helpful resources, and feel free to reach out through the contact page!</p>
