        <h2 class="discussion-title">Understanding Community Cats</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">Community cats are cats who live outdoors and don’t have a traditional home. They are usually divided into two groups: stray cats and feral cats.</p>
        <p class="discussion-text"><strong>Stray cats</strong> are cats that were once pets. They are used to being around people but may have become lost or were abandoned. Stray cats can often become friendly again and may be adopted into homes.</p>
        <p class="discussion-text"><strong>Feral cats</strong> were born and raised in the wild or have lived outside for a very long time without close contact with people. Because of this, they are usually scared of humans and prefer to avoid them. Feral cats don’t usually enjoy being touched or living indoors, so it’s best for them to stay outside in the places they know.</p>
        <p class="discussion-text">Even though community cats live outside, they still need help. Caregivers play an important role by feeding the cats, watching over them, and helping keep the group (called a colony) healthy and safe.</p>
      
        <h2 class="discussion-title">How to Feed Stray Cats Responsibly</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">Feeding outdoor cats is a kind and helpful thing to do, but it’s important to do it responsibly. Try to feed the cats in a quiet, calm area where they feel safe. Give them healthy food and always clean up any leftovers, so you don’t attract bugs or wild animals.</p>
        <p class="discussion-text">Feeding the cats at the same time every day helps them feel more secure and builds trust between you and the cats. It also makes it easier to keep track of them and spot if one is missing or sick.</p>
      
        <h2 class="discussion-title">Trap-Neuter-Return-Manage (TNRM) Programs</h2>
        <p class="discussion-text">TNRM is a caring and smart way to help community cats. It stands for Trap-Neuter-Return-Manage. First, the cats are humanely trapped. Then they are taken to a veterinarian to be spayed (for females) or neutered (for males). After that, they are returned to their outdoor homes where they can live peacefully.</p>
        <p class="discussion-text">This program helps in many ways. It prevents more kittens from being born, which helps reduce the number of homeless cats. It also keeps the colony healthier and calmer, since fixed cats are less likely to fight or roam.</p>
        <p class="discussion-text">You can support TNRM by joining a local group, helping trap cats safely, or driving them to a vet clinic. Every small act helps!</p>
