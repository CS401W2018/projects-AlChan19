        <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
        <h3>Title and Topic of My Site:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title: </strong>"Cat Advocacy Hub"</li>
            <li><strong>Topic: </strong>The website will focus on raising awareness about cats, showcasing my personal stories of my cats from the Philippines and the BYU-Hawaii campus, and promoting adoption, fostering, and the importance of spaying and neutering. It will also serve as a resource hub for local cat advocacy organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Why I Chose This Topic: </strong>I chose this topic because of my deep love for cats and my desire to advocate for a better environment for them. Cats hold a special place in my heart, and through this website, I hope to educate others on the importance of adopting, fostering, and supporting organizations that help cats in our communities. One of my personal goals is to feed stray cats in the area, and I hope to encourage others to get involved as well. The website will also serve as a platform for sharing personal stories and information about cats, making it relatable to other cat lovers.</li>
