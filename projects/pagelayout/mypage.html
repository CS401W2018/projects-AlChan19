                <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" class="valorant-link">Valorant</a> is a competitive team-based first-person shooter developed by Riot Games and released in 2020.

                The Valorant Protocol is a secret organization that is made up of Agents, who are the game's playable characters.

                In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities that help the team achieve its objectives.

            <ul>
                <li>Sentinels &ndash; They protect the team by holding down areas, setting up defenses, and watching flanks. They also slow down enemies, create barriers, or detect enemy movements.</li>
                <li>Controllers &ndash; They use smokes to block off areas of the map to make offensive or defense easier.</li>
                <li>Initiators &ndash; They initiate attacks, flush out enemies, and help the team enter battle.</li>
                <li>Duelists &ndash; They focus on getting kills and pressuring the opposing team into making a mistake.</li>
            </ul>
