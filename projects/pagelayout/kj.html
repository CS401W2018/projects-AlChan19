                Killjoy is a sentinel agent who uses her inventions to control enemies and areas. Her abilities include Nanoswarm and Alarmbot which are her basic abilities, Turret which is her signature ability, and Lockdown which is her ultimate ability.

                She is my main agent to use because she is easy to play, her abilities are excellent for defensive plays, and her skills are fun to use.
